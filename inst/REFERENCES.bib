abstract     = {Summary Plant roots originated independently in lycophytes and euphyllophytes, whereas early vascular plants were rootless. The organization of the root apical meristem in euphyllophytes is well documented, especially in the model plant Arabidopsis. However, little is known about lycophyte roots and their molecular innovations during evolution. In this study, spatial transcriptomics was used to detect 97 root-related genes in the roots of the lycophyte Selaginella moellendorffii. A high number of genes showed expression patterns similar to what has been reported for seed plants, supporting the idea of a highly convergent evolution of mechanisms to control root development. Interaction and complementation data of SHORTROOT (SHR) and SCARECROW (SCR) homologs, furthermore, support a comparable regulation of the ground tissue (GT) between euphyllophytes and lycophytes. Root cap formation, in contrast, appears to be differently regulated. Several experiments indicated an important role of the WUSCHEL-RELATED HOMEOBOX13 gene SmWOX13a in Selaginella root cap formation. In contrast to multiple Arabidopsis WOX paralogs, SmWOX13a is able to induce root cap cells in Arabidopsis and has functionally conserved homologs in the fern Ceratopteris richardii. Lycophytes and a part of the euphyllophytes, therefore, may share a common mechanism regulating root cap formation, which was diversified or lost during seed plant evolution. In summary, we here provide a new spatial data resource for the Selaginella root, which in general advocates for conserved mechanisms to regulate root development but shows a clear divergence in the control of root cap formation, with a novel putative role of WOX genes in root cap formation in non-seed plants.},

abstract     = {The analysis of spatial point patterns is commonly focused on the distances to the nearest neighbor. The distance of organisms to the edge of the enclosure is also of interest in some biological studies performed in the laboratory. We define the B (border) function and derive its shape assuming complete spatial randomness (CSR) for square, rectangular, circular, and some three-dimensional arenas. The idea is then extended outside the laboratory setting to work with maps and points located in geographical regions. Commands in R (R Core Team, 2012) to calculate and plot the empirical BË† function are included. The B function, based on distances to the nearest edge, in addition to the G function, based on distances to the nearest neighbor, contributes to the understanding of the spatial distribution of the points.},

Here we demonstrate an evolution of sequential fluorescence in situ hybridization (seqFISH+). We show that seqFISH+ can image mRNAs for 10,000 genes in single cells---with high accuracy and sub-diffraction-limit resolution---in the cortex, subventricular zone and olfactory bulb of mouse brain, using a standard confocal microscope. The transcriptome-level profiling of seqFISH+ allows unbiased identification of cell classes and their spatial organization in tissues. In addition, seqFISH+ reveals subcellular mRNA localization patterns in cells and ligand--receptor pairs across neighbouring cells. This technology demonstrates the ability to generate spatial cell atlases and to perform discovery-driven studies of biological processes in situ.},

abstract     = {The immune system is critical in modulating cancer progression, but knowledge of immune composition, phenotype, and interactions with tumor is limited. We used multiplexed ion beam imaging by time-of-flight (MIBI-TOF) to simultaneously quantify in situ expression of 36 proteins covering identity, function, and immune regulation at sub-cellular resolution in 41 triple-negative breast cancer patients. Multi-step processing, including deep-learning-based segmentation, revealed variability in the composition of tumor-immune populations across individuals, reconciled by overall immune infiltration and enriched co-occurrence of immune subpopulations and checkpoint expression. Spatial enrichment analysis showed immune mixed and compartmentalized tumors, coinciding with expression of PD1, PD-L1, and IDO in a cell-type- and location-specific manner. Ordered immune structures along the tumor-immune border were associated with compartmentalization and linked to survival. These data demonstrate organization in the tumor-immune microenvironment that is structured in cellular composition, spatial arrangement, and regulatory-protein expression and provide a framework to apply multiplexed imaging to immune oncology.},

abstract     = {Tumor microenvironments (TMEs) contain vast amounts of information on patient{\textquoteright}s cancer through their cellular composition and the spatial distribution of tumor cells and immune cell populations. Exploring variations in TMEs among patients and cancer types, as well as determining the extent to which this information can predict variables such as patient survival or treatment success with emerging immunotherapies, is of great interest. Moreover, in the face of a large number of potential spatial cell interactions to consider, we often wish to identify specific interactions that are useful in making such predictions. We present an approach to achieve these goals based on summarizing spatial relationships in the TME using spatial K functions, and then applying functional data analysis and random forest models to both predict outcomes of interest and identify important spatial relationships. This approach is shown to be effective in simulation experiments. We further used the proposed approach to interrogate two real data sets of Multiplexed Ion Beam Images of TMEs in triple negative breast cancer and lung cancer patients. The methods proposed are publicly available in a companion R package funkycells.Author summary Spatial data on the tumor microenvironment (TME) are becoming more prevalent. Existing methods to interrogate such data often have several deficiencies: (1) they rely on estimating the spatial relationships among cells by examining simple counts of cells within a single radius, (2) they do not come with ways to evaluate the statistical significance of any findings, or (3) they consider multiple individual interactions resulting in overly optimistic estimates of interaction importances. Our approach, which leverages techniques in spatial statistics and uses a benchmark ensemble machine learning method addresses (1), since the K functions used encode the relative densities of cells over all radii up to a user-selected maximum radius, and (2) we have developed a custom approach based on permutation and cross-validation to evaluate the statistical significance of any findings of significant spatial interactions in the TME, (3) over potentially multiple interactions. Our approach is also freely available with an R implementation called funkycells. In the analysis of two real data sets, we have seen that the method performs well, and gives the expected results. We think this will be a robust tool to add to the toolbox for researchers looking to interrogate, what can be sometimes unwieldy, TME data.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

abstract     = {Spatial omics technologies localize individual molecules at subcellular resolution, shedding light on the spatial micro-organisation of living organisms. Yet the development of analysis methods struggles to keep pace with growing numbers of molecules, features and replicates being measured, and with new scientific questions arising on single molecules{\textquoteright} localization patterns. To meet this need, we present smoppix, a nonparametric analysis method based on the probabilistic index, which unifies tests for several univariate and bivariate localization patterns, such as aggregation of transcripts or colocalization of transcript pairs, in a single framework. These tests can be performed across tissues as well as within cells, while accounting for nested design structures. The high-dimensionality of the data is exploited for variance weighting and for providing a meaningful background null distribution, unique for every individual molecule. smoppix sidesteps segmentation, warping, edge correction and density estimation, and scales to high numbers of molecules and replicates thanks to an exact permutation null distribution. We demonstrate its power by unearthing spatial patterns in four published datasets from different kingdoms, and validate some findings experimentally on Selaginella moellendorfii roots.
