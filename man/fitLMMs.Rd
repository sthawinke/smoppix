\description{
The PI is used as outcome variable in a linear (mixed) model,
with design variables as regressors. Separate models are fitted for every combination of gene
and PI. fitLMMsSingle() is the workhorse function for a single point pattern, fitSingleLmmModel() for a single feature.

getResults() extracts effect size estimates, standard errors and adjusted p-values for a certain parameter
from a linear model.
}
\details{
Genes or gene pairs with insufficient observations will be silently
omitted. When randomVars is provided as a vector, independent random
intercepts are fitted for them by default. Providing them separated by '\' or
':' as in the lmer formulas is also allowed to reflect nesting structure, 
but the safest is to construct the formula yourself and pass it onto fitLMMs.

It is by default assumed that random effects are nested within the point
 patterns. This means for instance that cells with the same name but from
 different point patterns are assigned to different random effects. Set
 'randomNested' to FALSE to override this behaviour.
